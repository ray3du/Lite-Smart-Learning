This pull of gravity is called weight. 2. Force of friction – this is a force which opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact with each other. Friction in fluids is known as viscosity. 3. Tension force – this is the pull or compression of a string or spring at both its ends. 4. Upthrust force – this is the upward force acting on an object immersed in a fluid. 5. Cohesive and adhesive forces – cohesive is the force of attraction of molecules of the same kind while adhesive is the force of attraction of molecules of different kinds. 6. Magnetic force – this is a force which causes attraction or repulsion in a magnet. 7. Electrostatic force – this is the force of attraction or repulsion of static charges. 8. Centripetal force – this is a force which constrains a body to move in a circular orbit or path. 9. Surface tension – this is the force which causes the surface of a liquid to behave like a stretched skin. This force is cohesive.

        subTopic1.setText("An acid may be defined as a substance that turns litmus red. A base may be defined as a substance that turns litmus blue. An indicator is a substance that shows whether another substance is a base/alkaline,acid or neutral Acids There are some common and naturally occurring acids as shown in the table below   However, acids commonly used and found in a school laboratory are not naturally occurring They are mineral acids as illustrated below   Mineral acids are manufactured to very high concentration. They are corrosive (causes painful wounds on contact with the skin) and attack/reacts with garments/clothes/metals. In a school laboratory, they are mainly used when added a lot of water. This is called diluting. Diluting ensures the concentration of the acid is safely low. Bases Bases are opposite of acids. Most bases do not dissolve in water. Bases which dissolve in water are called alkalis. Some common alkalis and their uses include;   Indicators An acid-base indicator is a substance used to identify whether another substance is alkaline or acidic. An acid-base indicator works by changing to different colors in neutral, acidic and alkaline solutions/dissolved in water. In an experiment to test whether solutions are acidic or alkaline, a simple acid-base indicator made of flower extracts would return the following results;    Solutions of the same nature show similar changes.  Common indicators are used in school laboratories. They are cheap, readily available and easy to store. Common indicators include: Litmus, phenolphthalein, methyl orange, screened methyl orange, bromothymol blue.  The following table shows different reults when indicators are used to test dofferent solutions   The following table shows the changes shown by indicators in different types of solution.   The Universal Indicator Universal indicator is a mixture of other indicator dyes. The indicator uses the pH scale that shows the strength of bases and acids in a range of 1-14 as follows  (i) pH values 1, 2, 3 shows a substance is a strongly acid (ii) pH values 4, 5, 6 shows a substance is a weakly acid (iii) pH value 7 shows a substance is a neutral (iv) pH values 8, 9, 10, 11 shows a substance is a weak base/alkali. (v) pH values 12, 13, 14 shows a substance is a strong base/alkali  The universal indicator is available as: universal indicator paper/pH paper and universal indicator solution.  When determining the pH of a unknown solution using pH paper, the pH paper is dipped into the unknown solution. It changes/turn to a certain colour. The new colour is marched/compared to its corresponding one on the pH chart to get the pH value.  When determining the pH of a unknown solution using universal indicator solution, about 3 drops of the universal indicator solution is added into about 5cm3 of the unknown solution in a test tube. It changes/turn to a certain colour. The new colour is marched/compared to its corresponding one on the pH chart to get the pH value. Important notes 1. All the mineral acids Hydrochloric, sulphuric (VI) and nitric (V) acids are strong acids 2. Two alkalis/soluble bases, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are strong bases/alkali. Ammonia solution is a weak base/alkali. All other bases are weakly alkaline. 3. Pure/deionized water is a neutral solution. 4. Common salt/sodium chloride is a neutral salt. 5. When an acid and an alkali/base are mixed, the final product has pH 7 and is neutral. Properties of Acids Physical Properties of Acids 1. Acids have a characteristic sour taste 2. Most acids are colourless liquids 3. Mineral acids are odorless. Organic acids have characteristic smell 4. All acids have pH less than 7 5. All acids turn blue litmus paper red, methyl orange red and phenolphthalein colourless. 6. All acids dissolve in water to form an acidic solution. 7. Most do not dissolve in organic solvents like propanone, kerosene, tetrachloromethane, petrol. Chemical Properties of Acids 1. All acids react with reactive metals to form a salt and produce /evolve hydrogen gas. Metal + Acid ------> Salt + Hydrogen gas  The following are reactions between metals and acids   2. All acids react with carbonates and hydrogen carbonates to form salt, water and produce /evolve carbon (IV) oxide gas. Metal carbonate + Acid -----> Salt + Water + Carbon(IV)oxide gas Metal hydrogen carbonate + Acid -----> Salt + Water + Carbon (IV) oxide gas  All metal carbonates/hydrogen carbonates react with dilute acids to produce bubbles of carbon (IV) oxide gas. Carbon (IV) oxide gas is a colourless gas that extinguishes a burning splint. When carbon (IV) oxide gas is bubbled in lime water, a white precipitate is formed.   3. All acids react with bases to form a salt and water only. The reaction of an acid with metal oxides/hydroxides (bases) to salt and water only is called neutralization reaction.  The reaction with alkalis requires a suitable indicator. The colour of the indicator changes when all the acid has reacted with the soluble solution of the alkali  The following are reactions between acids and bases")
        subTopic2.setText("The Atmosphere The atmosphere is made up of air, a mixture of colourless, odorless gases which is felt as wind. There are various gases in the atmosphere a listed below with their percentage composition; (i) Nitrogen - 78% (ii) Oxygen - 21% (iii) Carbon (IV) Oxide - 0.03% (iv) Noble gases - 1% (v) Water Vapour - varies by region There are different experiments that could be used to demonstrate presence and composition of the above gases in air Some of them include; Finding the composition of air supporting combustion using a candle stick Procedure Measure the length of an empty gas jar M1. Place a candle stick on a Petri dish. Float it on water in basin/trough. Cover it with the gas jar. Mark the level of the water in the gas jar M2. Remove the gas jar. Light the candle sick. Carefully cover it with the gas jar. Observe for two minutes. Mark the new level of the water M3. Set up of apparatus   The first image shows the setup when experiment is setup, and the second setup shows the setup after the experiment The observations are made because; Candle burns in air. In a closed system (vessel), the candle continues to burn using the part of air that support burning/combustion. This is called the active part of air. The candle goes off/extinguished when all the active part of air is used up. The level of the water rises to occupy the space /volume occupied by the used active part of air  NOTE: The experiment is better when very dilute sodium/potassium hydroxide is used instead of water. Dilute Potassium/ sodium hydroxide absorb Carbon (IV) oxide gas that comes out from burning/combustion of candle stick.  From the setup above, the percentage composition of active part of air (oxygen) is calculated as follows;   There is a host of experiments that can be done to find the composition of the active part of air (oxygen) as follows; a) Using copper turnings as illustrated below This is because copper reacts with oxygen to form Copper (II) Oxide   Copper + Oxygen  Copper(II)Oxide  Important Notes - The cotton wool in the experiment copper turnings from being blown into the syringe/out of the glass tube. - Air is passed through the glass tube repeatedly to ensure all the active part of air is used up. - Passing air through the glass tube slowly allows enough time of contact between the active part of and the heated copper turnings. - Colour changes from brown to black due to the reaction of brown copper metal with oxygen to form copper (II) oxide. - The reaction reduces the amount/volume of oxygen in syringe “B” leaving the inactive part of air, because copper only react with oxygen when heated. - The percentage of active part of air is theoretically higher because not all the active part of air reacted with copper. - If the copper turnings are replaced with magnesium shavings the % of active part of air obtained is extraordinary very high because magnesium is more reactive than copper, and the reaction is highly exothermic. Hence it generates enough heat for magnesium to react with both oxygen and nitrogen in the air.  Magnesium + Oxygen  Magnesium (II) Oxide Magnesium + Nitrogen  Magnesium (II) Nitride b) Using alkaline pyrogallol In this test, the colour of pyrogallol/1, 2, 3-trihydroxobenzene change to brown. This is because oxygen gas is absorbed by alkaline pyrogallol/1,2,3-trihydroxobenzene. c) Testing the presence of carbon (IV) oxide in air using lime water Set up the experiment as shown below and pass tap water slowly into the empty flask.   Important Notes - The paper cover ensures that no air enters into the lime water. - When water enters the flask, it forces the air from the flask into the lime water. - A white precipitate is formed. The white precipitate dissolves on prolonged bubbling of air. - Lime water is Calcium hydroxide / Ca(OH)2 - The white precipitate formed is Calcium carbonate/ CaCO3 Calcium hydroxide + carbon (IV) oxide  Calcium carbonate + water Ca (OH)2(aq) + CO2 (g)  CaCO3(s) + H2O (l)  - When the white precipitate dissolves, the solution formed is Calcium hydrogen carbonate/ CaHCO3 Calcium carbonate + water + carbon (IV) oxide  Calcium hydrogen carbonate CaCO3(s) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)  CaHCO3 (aq) - Carbon (IV) oxide forms a white precipitate with lime water that dissolves in excess of the gas.  Oxygen About 50% of the earth’s crust consist of Oxygen combined with other elements e.g. oxides of metals. About 70% of the earth is water made up of Hydrogen and Oxygen. About 20% by volume of the atmospheric gases is Oxygen that form the active part of air. Laboratory Preparation of Oxygen  (i) Using Hydrogen Peroxide - Half fill a trough/basin with tap water. Place a bee hive shelf/stand into the water. - Completely fill the gas jar with water and invert in onto the bee hive shelf/stand. - Clamp a round bottomed flask and set up the apparatus as below.   IMPORTANT NOTES: 1. Rapid effervescence/bubbling/fizzing occurs when the hydrogen peroxide is added into the flask 2. The gas produced is colourless and odourless 3. The method of gas collection can be referred to as; over water, or upward delivery, or downward displacement of water. 4. The gas can be collected through the method stated above because its only slightly soluble in water. 5. Manganese (IV) oxide is used as a catalyst in the reaction. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction but remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction 6. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes slowly to form water and Oxygen gas. 7. A little Manganese (IV) oxide speeds up the rate of decomposition by reducing the time taken for a given volume of Oxygen to be produced. 8. The equation for the reaction is as follows; Hydrogen peroxide  Water + Oxygen 2H2O2 (aq)  2H2O (l) + O2 (g) 9. Lowering a glowing splint slowly into a gas jar containing Oxygen gas relights/rekindles the splint. This is because Oxygen relights/rekindles a glowing splint; which is a confirmatory test for the presence of oxygen gas.  (i) Using Sodium Peroxide - Half fill a trough/basin with tap water and add four drops of phenolphthalein indicator. - Place a bee hive shelf/stand into the water. - Completely fill a gas jar with water and invert in onto the bee hive shelf/stand. - Clamp a round bottomed flask and set up the apparatus as below.   IMPORTANT NOTES: 1. Rapid effervescence/bubbling/fizzing is observed when water is added into the flask containing sodium peroxide. 2. A colourless and odourless gas is produced. 3. The gas is collected using the 'over water' method because oxygen is only slightly soluble in water. 4. The gas relights/rekindles a glowing splint. 5. The reaction that occurs is represented by the equation below; Sodium peroxide + Water  Sodium hydroxide + Oxygen 2Na2O2 (aq) + 2H2O (l)  4NaOH (aq) + O2 (g) NB: Oxygen can also be prepared using potassium chlorate (V) / 2KClO3 Uses of Oxygen  a) Oxygen is put in cylinders for use where natural supply is not sufficiently enough. It could include in places and activities like like mountain climbing, deep sea diving, saving life in hospitals. b) A mixture of oxygen and some other gases produces a flame that is very hot. - Oxy-acetylene/ethyne flame is produced when Ethyne/acetylene gas is burnt in pure oxygen. The flame has a temperature of about 3000oC.It is used for welding /cutting metals. - Oxy-hydrogen flame is produced when Hydrogen is burn in pure oxygen. The flame has a temperature of about 2000oC. It is used also for welding /cutting metals. c) Oxy-hydrogen mixture is used as rocket fuel.")

        subTopic4.setText("Substances are classified as either pure or impure. - An impure substance contains two or more substances. - A pure substance is made up of a pure solid, pure liquid or pure gas.  Mixture - a combination of two or more pure substances which can be separated by physical means  Types of Mixtures (i) Solutions/solid-liquid dissolved mixture When a solute dissolves in a solvent it forms a uniform mixture called solution. A substance/liquid in which another substance dissolves is called solvent. A substance /solid /gas which dissolves in a solvent is called solute. For instance, a solution of Sodium chloride is obtained from sodium chloride (solute) and water (solvent)  The following equation illustrates the formation of a solution from the solute and solvent.    (ii) Suspension/ precipitates/solid-liquid mixture which do not dissolve Some solid substances do not dissolve in a liquid. They are said to be insoluble in the solvent. When an insoluble solid is put in liquid  - Some particles remain suspended/floating in the liquid to form a suspension /precipitate - Some particles sink/settle to the bottom to form sediments after being allowed to stand  For intance, putting maize flour in water creates a white precipitate (iii) Miscible /Liquid-liquid mixtures Miscible liquids form a uniform mixture and do not form layers The particles of one liquid are smaller than the particles of the other and therefore, the smaller particles occupy the spaces between the bigger particles  Examples: Water and Ethanol and miscible liquids, and kerosene and turpentine are also miscible (iv) Immiscible /Liquid-liquid mixtures Immiscible mixtures do not form uniform mixtures, they form layers.  The particles of one liquid cannot occupy the spaces between the particles of the other. The heavier particles settle at the bottom. The less dense particles settle on top  For instance, Kerosene and water are immiscible (iv) Solid-solid mixtures/Alloys An alloy is a uniform mixture of two metals formed on solidifying The following table shows the common alloys of metals   Methods of Separating Mixtures (i) Decantation Through this method, sediments can be separated from a liquid by pouring out the liquid. Experimentally, one can put some sand in a beaker. Add about 200cm3 of water. Allow sand to settle. Pour off water carefully into another beaker. One will observe that sand settles at the bottom as sediments and less clean water is poured out. (ii) Filtration Filtration is the method of separating insoluble mixtures/particles/solids from a liquid. In an experiment, one should fold a filter paper to fit well into a filter funnel. Place the funnel in an empty 250 cm3 beaker. Put one spatula end full of soil into 50cm3 of water. Stir. Put the soil/water mixture into the filter funnel.  From that experiment, one shall observe that clean water is collected below the filter funnel and soil remains above the filter paper. PS: (iii)Filtration is like improved decantation (iii) Evaporation This is a method of separating a solute/solid from its solution. This involves heating a solution (solvent and solute)to vaporize the solvent out of the solution mixture leaving pure solute/solid For instance, a solution of salt and water is separated through evaporation. Soil and salt can also be separated through evaporation, first by adding them to water, filtering the soil, and the evaporating the water to be left with salt. (iv) Distillation This is an improved evaporation where both the solute and the solvent in the solution are separated /collected. The process separates a solution into constituent solid solute and the solvent. It involves heating the solution to evaporate/vaporize the solvent out. The solvent vapour is then condensed back to a liquid. An example of this in an experiment would be to obtain copper (II) sulphate crystals and water from copper (II) sulphate solution. The following illustration shows how the pro0cess is undertaken.   (v) Fractional Distillation This method is an improved simple distillation used specifically to separate miscible mixtures with very close /near boiling points.  It is done in the following steps a) Heating the mixture in a conical/round bottomed /flat bottomed flask b) The conical/round bottomed /flat bottomed flask is connected to a long glass tube called fractionating column. NB: The fractionating column offers areas of condensation for the less volatile pure mixture packed with glass beads/broken glass/ porcelain/ shelves to increase the surface area of condensation c) When the vapours rise they condense on the glass beads/broken glass /porcelain / shelves which become hot. When the temperature of the glass beads/broken glass/porcelain/shelves is beyond the boiling point of the less volatile pure substance, the pure substance rise and condensation take place on the glass beads/broken glass/porcelain/shelves at a higher level on the fractionating column. The less volatile pure substance trickles/drips back down the fractionating column or back into the conical/round bottomed /flat bottomed flask to be heated again d) The fractionating column is connected to a Liebig condenser. The Liebig condenser has a cold water inlet and outlet circulation. The more volatile mixture that reach the top of the fractionating column is condenses by the Liebig condenser into a receiver. It is collected as the first fraction. e) At the top of the fractionating column, a thermometer is placed to note/monitor the temperature of the boiling mixtures. Pure substances have constant/fixed boiling point. When one mixture is completely separated, the thermometer reading rises. f) When no more of the more volatile solvent is being separated, the mercury/alcohol level in the thermometer rises. The second /subsequent fractions are collected in the receiver after noting a rise the mercury/alcohol level in the thermometer. g) Each fraction collected should be confirmed from known physical/chemical properties/characteristic.  The following is a set-up showing how the experiment is undertaken when separating water from ethanol.   Fractional distillation is used industrially. It is used in distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery, as well as distillation of air (vi) Separation of immiscibles (Using a separating funnel) This method is used to separate liquids that form layers on mixing. Immiscible mixture arrange themselves according to their densities. The denser liquid sink to the bottom. The less dense liquid floats on the denser one. Immiscible mixtures can be separated from each other by using a separating funnel. Paraffin and water can be separated using this method. The apparatus are set up as follows, with the denser liquid being collected first, and the less dense one collected after   (vii) Sublimation/deposition Some solids on heating do not melt to a liquid but change directly to a gas. The process by which a solid changes to a gas is called sublimation. The gas cools back and changes directly to a solid. The process by which a gas changes to a solid is called deposition. Sublimation and deposition therefore are the same but opposite processes. Among substances that undergo sublimation include; iodine, carbon (IV) oxide, benzoic acid, ammonium, camphor, and iron (III) chloride. Mixtures between those substances can be separated through sublimation and deposition Different experiments can be used to show sublimation and deposition in separation of substances. (viii) Chromatography Chromatography is a method of separating components of a solution mixture by passing it through a medium where the different components move at different rates. The medium through which the solution mixture is passed is called absorbent material.  Paper chromatography is a method of separating colored dyes by using paper as the absorbent material. Since dyes are insoluble/do not dissolve in water, ethanol and propanone are used as suitable solvents for dissolving the dye  Practically, a simple paper chromatography involve placing a dye/material on the absorbent material, adding slowly a suitable soluble solvent on the dye/material using a dropper, the solvent spread out on the absorbent material carrying the soluble dye away from the origin.  The spot on which the dye is initially/originally placed is called baseline. The farthest point the solvent spread is called solvent front. The farthest a dye can be spread by the solvent depend on: (i) Density of the dye - the denser the dye, the less it spread from the basely by the solvent. (ii) Stickiness of the dye-some dyes sticks on the absorbent material more than other thus do not spread far from baseline.  When a drop of ink is placed on an absorbent material it sticks. On adding an eluting solvent, it dissolves the dye spread out with it. The denser and sticky pure dye move least. The least dense/sticky pure dye move farthest. A pure dye will produce the same chromatogram/spot if the same eluting solvent is used on the same absorbent material.  The chromatogram of pure dyes A, B ,C and a dye mixture D is shown below   (ix) Solvent Extraction Solvent extraction is a method of separating oil from nuts/seeds. Most nuts contain oil. First the nuts are crushed to reduce their size and increase the surface area. A suitable volatile solvent is added. The mixture is filtered. The filtrate solvent is then allowed to crystallize leaving the oil/fat. If a filter paper is rubbed/smeared with the oil/fat, it becomes translucent. This is the test for the presence of oil/fat. (x) Crystallization This is the process of using solubility of a solute/solid to obtain the solute/solid crystals from a saturated solution by cooling or heating the solution  A crystal is the smallest regular shaped particle of a solute. Every solute has unique shape of its crystals. Some solutions form crystals when heated. This is because less solute dissolves at higher temperature. Some other solutions form crystals when cooled. This is because less solute dissolves at lower temperature.  For instance, one can crystallize copper (II) sulphate solution into its hydrated crystals  Experiment for crystallization could be performed as follows; Place about one spatula full of hydrated copper sulphate (VI) crystals into 200cm3 of distilled water in a beaker. Stir. Continue adding a little more of the hydrated copper sulphate (VI) crystals and stirring until no more dissolve. Decant/filter. Cover the filtrate with a filter paper. Pierce and make small holes on the filter paper cover. Preserve the experiment for about seven days.")
        subTopic5.setText("Water Pure water is a colourless, odourless, tasteless, neutral liquid. Pure water does not exist in nature but naturally in varying degree of purity. The main sources of water include rain, springs, borehole, lakes, seas and oceans Main Uses of Water (i) Drinking by animals and plants. (ii) Washing clothes. (iii) Bleaching and dyeing. (iv) Generating hydroelectric power. (v) Cooling industrial processes.  NOTEs: - Water dissolves many substances/solutes. - It is therefore called universal solvent. - It contains about 35% dissolved Oxygen which support aquatic fauna and flora. - Water naturally exists in three phases/states solid ice, liquid water and gaseous water vapour. - The three states of water are naturally inter-convertible in the water cycle as shown below   Explanation of the Water Cycle Liquid water in land, lakes, seas and oceans use the solar/sun energy to evaporate/vapourize to form water vapour/gas. Solar/sun energy is also used during transpiration by plants and respiration by animals. During evaporation, the water vapour rises up the earth’s surface. Temperatures decrease with height above the earth surface increase. Water vapour therefore cools as it rises up. At a height where it is cold enough to below 373Kelvin/100oC Water vapour looses enough energy to form tiny droplets of liquid. The process by which a gas/water vapour changes to a liquid is called condensation/liquidification. On further cooling, the liquid looses more energy to form ice/solid. The process by which a liquid/water changes to a ice/solid is called freezing/solidification. Minute/tiny ice/solid particles float in the atmosphere and coalesce/join together to form clouds. When the clouds become too heavy they fall to the earth’s surface as rain/snow as the temperature increase with the fall.

NOTES: - The color changes from blue to pink - Anhydrous cobalt (II) chloride is blue - Anhydrous cobalt (II) chloride gains/reacts with water to form hydrated cobalt (II) chloride, which is pink - Hydrated cobalt (II) chloride contains water of crystallization. - This is another confirmatory test of water where blue anhydrous cobalt (II) chloride chnage to pink hydrated cobalt (II) chloride Anhydrous cobalt (II) chloride (blue) + Water  Hydrated cobalt (II) chloride (pink) CoCl2 (s) + 5H2O (l)  CoCl2.5H2O(s) Burning a Candle in Air The procedure for the experiment is conducted as follows; - Put about 2g of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals in a boiling tube. - Put about 5cm3 of lime water in a boiling tube. - Light a small candle stick and place it below an inverted thistle/filter funnel - Collect the products of the burning candle by setting the apparatus as below   NOTES:- - The sanction pump pulls the products of burning into the inverted funnel. - Colour of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) changes from white to blue. - A white precipitate is formed in the lime water/calcium hydroxide. - When a candle burn it forms a water and carbon (IV) oxide. - Water turns anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) changes from white to blue. - Carbon (IV) oxide gas forms white precipitate when bubbled in lime water/calcium hydroxide. - Hydrogen in the wax burn to form water. - Carbon in the wax burn to form carbon (IV) oxide - The candle before burning therefore contained only Carbon and Hydrogen only. - A compound made up of hydrogen and carbon is called Hydrocarbon. - A candle is a hydrocarbon. - Hydrocarbons burn in air to form water and carbon (IV) oxide gas. Water Pollution This occurs when undesirable substances are added into the water. There are different sources of water pollution as follows;  (i) Industrial chemicals being disposed into water bodies like rivers, lakes and oceans. (ii) Discharging untreated /raw sewage into water bodies. (iii) Leaching of insecticides/herbicides form agricultural activities into water bodies. (iv) Discharging non-biodegradable detergents after domestic and industrial use into water bodies. (v) Petroleum oil spilling by ships and oil refineries (vi) Toxic/poisonous gases from industries dissolving in rain. (vii) Acidic gases from industries dissolving in rain to form “acid rain” (viii) Discharging hot water into water bodies. This reduces the quantity of dissolved Oxygen in the water killing the aquatic fauna and flora.  It is important to reduce water pollution, which can be done by: (i) Reducing the use of agricultural fertilizers and chemicals in agricultural activities. (ii) Use of biological control method instead of insecticides and herbicides (iii) Using biodegradable detergents")
